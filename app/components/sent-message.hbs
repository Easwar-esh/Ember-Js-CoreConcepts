    <p>
        I love the idea!I'm really excited about where this year's EmberConf is
        going,U'm sure it's going to be the best one yet.Some quick notes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Definitely agree that we should double the coffee budget this year (it
            really is impressive how much we go through!)
        </li>
        <li>
            A blimp would definitely  the venue very easy to find,but i think it might
            be a bit out of our budget.Maybe we could rent some spotlights instead?
        </li>
        <li>
            We absolutely will need more hamster wheels,last year's line was
            <em>way</em> to long.Will get on that now before rental season hits
            its peak.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let me know when you've nailed down the dates!</p>
